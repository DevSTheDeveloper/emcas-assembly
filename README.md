# EMCAS to SPIM Implementation

This project provides a reference for helping people learn SPIM (MIPS Assembly Language) through an illustrative example that shows how code written in a high-level EMCAS-like syntax can be translated into SPIM assembly code.

## Purpose

The aim of this project is to serve as a learning resource for anyone studying SPIM and MIPS assembly. It demonstrates how high-level programming constructs can be converted into low-level assembly code, helping beginners understand the relationship between high-level and low-level programming languages.

## Whatâ€™s Inside
  - Example code written in EMCAS-like syntax (similar to Java).
  - Corresponding SPIM assembly code to demonstrate the translation process.
  - A simple walkthrough to help users understand how high-level code gets mapped to assembly instructions.

## How to Use

This project is a reference guide. There are no executable tools or converters in the repository. Instead, it provides examples of code written in EMCAS-like syntax, followed by their SPIM equivalents, to help users understand how simple operations are handled in SPIM assembly.
