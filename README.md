EMCAS Code for Java to SPIM Implementation

This project implements a tool that translates EMCAS code (a Java-based language) into SPIM (a MIPS assembly language). The goal is to provide a straightforward process for converting high-level Java code into low-level MIPS instructions.

Features
	•	Converts Java-like EMCAS code into SPIM instructions.
	•	Enables running of converted code on the SPIM simulator.

Requirements
	•	Java Development Kit (JDK): Required to run the EMCAS code parser.
	•	SPIM Simulator: Required to run the MIPS assembly code generated from EMCAS.
